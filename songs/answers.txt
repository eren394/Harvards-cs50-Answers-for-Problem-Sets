Spotify uses metrics like danceability, energy, and valence to create
personalized experiences like "Spotify Wrapped."

For example, by calculating the average energy and valence of the songs
a user listens to, Spotify can determine their "Audio Aura" or mood.
High energy and high valence might suggest a "Happy" or "Energetic"
listener profile, while low valence might indicate a "Wistful" or
"Melancholic" mood.

Additionally, tracking the tempo and danceability helps Spotify
recommend similar songs to keep users engaged with new music that
fits their established rhythmic preferences.
